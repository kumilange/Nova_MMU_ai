migrate_skill_to_routine.py -- Skill -> Routine rename
======================================================
Renames the crystallized-memory concept from "Skill" to "Routine" in an
existing graph, so it stops colliding with agent SKILL.md files (issue #2).

Nothing about the behaviour changes. Only names change:

    :Skill              ->  :Routine
    :SkillProposal      ->  :RoutineProposal
    [:EXTENDS_SKILL]    ->  [:EXTENDS_ROUTINE]
    sk.skill_id         ->  sk.routine_id
    p.skill_score       ->  p.routine_score
    m.pre_skill_color   ->  m.pre_routine_color

The skill_id / proposal_id / proposal_key constraints and the skill_embedding
vector index are dropped; the server recreates them at startup. proposal_id and
proposal_key keep their names, so they must be dropped explicitly or the
server's CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS no-ops against the stale :SkillProposal
binding and :RoutineProposal ends up with no uniqueness constraint.

RUN ONCE, WITH THE SERVER STOPPED:
    docker compose stop mmu-server
    python migrate_skill_to_routine.py
    docker compose build mmu-server && docker compose up -d mmu-server

Unlike the valence migration this one is NOT safe to run live -- the server
queries :Skill by label, so a half-relabelled graph is a graph where routines
are invisible.

Run with --dry-run to preview without writing anything.
Run with --status to just count what would be migrated.
