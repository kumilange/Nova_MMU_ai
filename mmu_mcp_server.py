"""
MMU MCP Server — Phase 6.6 (Authentic Emotional Range)
========================
Pure Python stdlib only (json, sys, requests).
Works on Python 3.6+. No 'mcp' package needed.

Speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio — exactly what LM Studio expects.
Bridges tool calls to the MMU Docker REST server on port 8765.

Phase 3 addition: session_bundle fetched on initialize and injected via
get_session_context tool. Nova calls this once at session start and receives
pre-assembled context from all GRP domains — no need to manually search
for common context.

Install: pip install requests
Run:     python mmu_mcp_server.py

    into the container. This one is a HOST process launched by the chat client,
    so it never saw those variables -- MMU_ALLOW_MODEL_CRYSTALLIZE was set in
    .env, read correctly by the container, and invisible here. The tool it
    controls was silently never registered, which looks exactly like a model
    declining to use it.

    Real environment variables still win, so an MCP config that sets one
    explicitly keeps working.
